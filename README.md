This repository contains models to predict parking availability and image labels using the Yelp dataset. The following models have been implemented and deployed:

1. **DNN Model**: Predicts if a business has parking and whether it is validated.
2. **Adaboost/XGBoost Model**: Predicts if a business has parking and whether it is validated.
3. **CNN Model**: Predicts the label of an image (from the Yelp dataset).
4. **DNN Model**: Predicts the label of an image (from the Yelp dataset).
